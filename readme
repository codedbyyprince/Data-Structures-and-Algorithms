🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — My Learning Journey

Welcome to my DSA repository — a space where I document my journey of learning, understanding, and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

This isn’t just a repo of programs. It’s a roadmap of how my logic grows — from basic thinking to optimized reasoning.
Every file, every folder, every comment reflects my goal: to understand how things truly work, not just how to make them run.

🎯 Purpose
    
-> Build a solid foundation in DSA.
-> Write clean, efficient, and meaningful code.
-> Understand the logic behind every algorithm deeply.
-> Track my growth step by step as I move from basics to advanced.

📚 Structure of the Repository (I will try to maintain it for sure)

Each concept is added carefully with:

Organized folders for each topic

Clean and consistent variable names

Clear comments explaining the logic

Multiple approaches where possible (basic → better → optimized)


📈 Goals

Think in algorithms, not syntax.

Solve problems regularly and systematically.

Refactor older solutions as I learn better logic.

Move from DSA → Competitive Programming → System Design.

🧭 My Approach

I start from concept → pseudocode → implementation → optimization.
No rushing, no shortcuts — just consistent improvement and deep understanding.

💬 Final Note

This repository is open for anyone who wants to learn alongside or peek into how my logic evolves.
If you find something off or have suggestions, I’m always open — this journey is about evolution, not perfection.
